# 🚀 SLAM Practice

This repository showcases my practice and implementations of **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)** algorithms for mobile robots. The work here is based on various courses and projects, implemented in both **Python** and **C++**. 

It includes a comprehensive exploration of SLAM concepts, ranging from foundational techniques like Bayes Filters to advanced methods like Particle Filters and Right-Invariant Extended Kalman Filters. The projects aim to strengthen theoretical understanding and practical application of SLAM on mobile robotic platforms.
