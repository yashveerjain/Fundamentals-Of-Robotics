# SLAM Practice 
This Repository is for practicing SLAM, undertook different courses and implemented different algorithms, for SLAM on mobile robots.

* Implemented both on python and C++.
* Implemented SLAM on Mobile Robots.

## python/umich
* Contains the howework from Umich course on Mobile Robotics.
* homework 1:
    - Understanding Bayes Filter
* homework 2:
    - Derived and Implemented Linear Estimation techniques such as, Bayesian Inference, and Kalman Filter
* homework 3:
    - Derived and Implemented Particle Filter and Extended Kalman Filter, for the 2D Localization problem, presented [here](python/umich/homework-03/NA568_HW3_W22.pdf)
    - More details present [here](python/umich/Readme.md)
